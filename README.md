# Competitive programming library
The purpose of this is to save my template used for competitive programming, as well as saving some interesting/educational problems

Name of cpp file : 
Convention : [Site] - [Problem code or name].cpp
- `CF - 986D.cpp` --> Codeforces problem
- `AC - abc238_e.cpp` --> Atcoder problem, ABC contest 238, problem E
- `CC - BOMBBLAST.cpp` --> Codechef problem
- `CSES - Dynamic RMQ.cpp` --> CSES Problemset

Since LeetCode DSA problems are relatively simple compare to Codeforces or Codechef, I put it in a separate folder, so Leetcode problems file won't follow the above naming convention : It only has problem code or name

For example : `99. Recover BST.cpp` instead of `LC - 99. RecoverBST.cpp`

A lot of the templates I use are taken from https://github.com/ShahjalalShohag/code-library. I do not own these templates
