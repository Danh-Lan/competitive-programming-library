# Competitive programming library
The purpose of this is to save my template used for competitive programming, as well as saving some good problems

Name of cpp file : 
Convention : [Site] - [Problem code or name].cpp
- CF - 986D.cpp --> Codeforces problem
- AC - abc238_e.cpp --> Atcoder problem, ABC contest 238, problem E
- CC - BOMBBLAST.cpp --> Codechef problem
- CSES - Dynamic RMQ.cpp --> CSES Problemset

A lot of the templates I use are taken from https://github.com/ShahjalalShohag/code-library. I do not own these templates
