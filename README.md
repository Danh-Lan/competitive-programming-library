# Competitive programming library
The purpose of this is to save my template used for competitive programming, as well as saving some good problems

Name of cpp file : 
- 986D.cpp --> Codeforces problem
- abc238_e --> Atcoder problem, ABC contest 238, problem E

A lot of the templates I use are taken from https://github.com/ShahjalalShohag/code-library. I do not own these templates
